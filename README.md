### Description:
Explore the dynamic growth of small renewable energy installations (MIOZE) in Poland from 2015 to the present using data obtained through the API provided by dane.gov.pl. Our interactive maps allow users to filter data by province, select a range of years from 2015 to the present, and filter installations based on energy types such as solar, wind, hydro, biogas, and biomass.

### Key Features:

* **Interactive Maps**: Filter data by province to visualize the distribution of small renewable energy installations across Poland.
* **Time Range Filter**: Choose specific years to observe the evolving landscape of renewable energy installations from 2015 to the present.
* **Energy Type Filters**: Explore data specific to solar, wind, hydro, biogas, and biomass installations, gaining insights into the diversity of renewable sources.
* **Bar Charts**: View bar charts illustrating the cumulative number of installed facilities in Poland. Charts showcase the growing number of registered entities producing electric energy and the increasing capacity in megawatts (MW).
* **Linear Growth Chart**: Track the growth of installed capacity in MW over time through a linear chart, providing a comprehensive overview of the increasing contribution of small renewable energy installations.
* **Map with All Locations**: Explore a comprehensive map displaying all locations with small renewable energy installations, providing a detailed geographic overview.
Note: Small renewable energy installations (MIOZE) refer to facilities generating electricity with capacities ranging from 50 kW to 1 MW. Access the interactive platform and gain valuable insights into Poland's sustainable energy development journey.
